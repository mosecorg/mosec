## Examples
- An [echo server](echo.py) that will sleep for a period of time given and return. It is a simple illustration of how multi-stage workload is implemented.
- An [image recognition server](resnet50_server.py) that will receive an image and classify accordingly ImageNet categories. It can be the starter code for any kind of computer vision model server.

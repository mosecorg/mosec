We provide examples across different ML frameworks and for various tasks in this section.

## Get started
All the examples in this section are self-contained and tested, feel free to grab one and run:

    python model_server.py

To test the server, we use `httpie` and `httpx` by default. You can have other choices but if you want to install them:

    pip install httpie httpx

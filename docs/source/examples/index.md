We provide examples across different ML frameworks and for various tasks in this section.

## Requirements

All the examples in this section are self-contained and tested. Feel free to grab one and run:

```shell
python model_server.py
```

To test the server, we use [`httpie`](https://github.com/httpie/httpie) and [`httpx`](https://github.com/encode/httpx) by default. You can have other choices but if you want to install them:

```shell
pip install httpie httpx
```

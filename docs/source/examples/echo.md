# Echo Example

An echo server is usually the very first server you wanna implement to get familiar with the framework.

This server sleeps for a given period and return. It is a simple illustration of how **multi-stage workload** is implemented. It also shows how to write a simple **validation** for input data.

The default JSON protocol will be used since the (de)serialization methods are not overridden in this demo. In particular, the input `data` of `Preprocess`'s `forward` is a dictionary decoded by JSON from the request body's bytes; and the output dictionary of `Postprocess`'s `forward` will be JSON-encoded as a mirrored process.

## **`echo.py`**

```{include} ../../../examples/echo.py
:code: python
```

## Start

```shell
python echo.py
```

## Test

```shell
http :8000/inference time=1.5
```
